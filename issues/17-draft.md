## The Big Project Syndrome

![The Big Project Syndrome](https://itamargilad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/1920px-Pieter_Bruegel_the_Elder_-_The_Tower_of_Babel_Rotterdam_-_Google_Art_Project_-_edited-1024x820.jpg)

There’s a common and highly destructive pattern I’m seeing time and again (and likely you have too). The leadership team falls in love with a big idea and turns it into a big project. This project becomes the top priority—apparently the future of the company depends on it. Other projects (including yesteryear’s top priorities) are deprioritized or defunded. Competing ideas are squashed like flies.

Experienced middle-managers and employees know there’s no point resisting the oncoming tsunami. The smart option is to ride the wave. So everyone gets spontaneously “excited” about the new thing: middle managers amplify the message, people come up with ways to take part and contribute. The project grows even larger and more important.

All projects turn out to be harder and more costly than we first think. Much more so large projects that span teams and departments. Invariably progress is slow, schedules run late, scope is cut, and it takes an heroic effort to cross the finish line. But when the product finally launches (much later than anyone expected) the results are underwhelming, to say the least. Customers are generally uninterested, key metrics are unaffected.

But this project is too important to fail, so the leaders now rally the troops for a massive rescue operation. Product teams launch supplementary features and redesigns. The marketing team badgers the users with reminders and cross-sells. Sales are on the phone trying to get customers to adopt. It feels like we’re just one feature, one campaign, away from breaking through. But we’re not. The vast majority of these projects end up as a colossal waste of time.

Output-focus is a key contributing factor here. In a company where goals and incentives are centered on execution and production, doing becomes more important than achieving. In this sense the big project serves an important purpose: it gives everyone something big and important to work on (and later to boast about in perf reviews.) Left unattended this culture can breed a particular type of manager that uses big projects as springboards for promotion.

## Announcing PSP Security Protocol is now open source

Almost a decade ago, we started encrypting traffic between our data centers to help protect user privacy. Since then, we gradually rolled out changes to encrypt almost all data in transit. Our approach is described in our Encryption in Transit whitepaper. While this effort provided invaluable privacy and security benefits, software encryption came at significant cost: it took ~0.7% of Google's processing power to encrypt and decrypt RPCs, along with a corresponding amount of memory. Such costs spurred us to offload encryption to our network interface cards (NICs) using PSP (a recursive acronym for PSP Security Protocol), which we are open sourcing today
