> → The main idea was to create the responsive & fastest ultimate solution for designers & developers updated to the latest design trends.
> → We had to make sure that is for anyone, not just developers, but for designers too, so Horizon UI comes with specially made Figma files.
> → Another important thing was to make a layered & detailed code structure, so every component & element has its own .js file, to be easy to customize.
