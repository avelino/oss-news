## SimpleLogin joins the Proton family

The past 6 months have been intense for SimpleLogin, with many new users, many new features, and many new technical challenges. I’m now happy to share this news with you: SimpleLogin is now part of the [Proton family](https://protonmail.com/).

SimpleLogin was started in 2019. After more than a year of coding, we launched a beta version in 2020 and a public version at the beginning of 2021. SimpleLogin’s mission is to protect your online identity and we follow a transparency model since the beginning: the code is 100% open source and product development decisions are discussed openly with the community. SimpleLogin has received a lot of positive feedback from the privacy community and with your help, we have built many new features while maintaining high reliability and stability.

## Automation is the serialization of understanding

> “Okay, we’re gonna take the existing RPM and use it to create a container image. Instead of running yum install on a server to install the RPM, we can now call the same command from a Docker file, and produce a container image.”

> “Docker run this container image. It works. We go to production. Docker run the same container image. It works.”

And maybe that’s all your team needs to do! And look, that’s okay. But I think understanding allows us to make that decision, and then we can decide what automation tool is the best for the job.

These fundamentals can be applied using different tools. The tools are not the fundamentals. It’s the ideas and concepts that we have been talking about today.

## How we lost 54k GitHub stars

I remember the rush of HTTPie becoming the top link on Hacker News for the first time and seeing the GitHub community build up. Over the years as we continued to improve the project it kept attracting widespread adoption. It became the most popular API tool on the platform, and the GitHub community grew to 54k stargazers and 1k+ watchers.

However, if you are one of our 55k stargazers and watchers, as of a few weeks ago you no longer are 💔

**What happened?**

Due to an unfortunate sequence of events, I accidentally made the project’s repository private for a moment. And GitHub cascade-deleted our community that took 10 years to build.

## Third npm protestware: 'event-source-polyfill' calls Russia out

![Third npm protestware: 'event-source-polyfill' calls Russia out](https://www.bleepstatic.com/content/hl-images/2022/03/17/npm-bg.png)

Developers are increasingly voicing their opinions through their open source projects in active use by thousands of software applications and organizations.

To do this, a maintainer adds broken code, protest messages, or undesired damaging functionality in the latest versions of their project without documenting it beforehand.

> if you (or the company you work for) use open source libraries you should be aware of the updates of the project you are using and pin the version of the library you are using

## What’s the Best Programming Language to Learn in 2022?

Some languages are popular and oversaturated, while others are trendy but obscure among recruiters. Either way it can be hard to find a job with them. Other coding languages are very old and it can be hard to break into an industry with developers who possess 20+ years of experience. Some are high in demand and low in supply, but very difficult to learn and apply.

> Why not look at the market behavior in the use of programming languages to know where to invest your time?
