## SimpleLogin joins the Proton family

The past 6 months have been intense for SimpleLogin, with many new users, many new features, and many new technical challenges. I‚Äôm now happy to share this news with you: SimpleLogin is now part of the [Proton family](https://protonmail.com/).

SimpleLogin was started in 2019. After more than a year of coding, we launched a beta version in 2020 and a public version at the beginning of 2021. SimpleLogin‚Äôs mission is to protect your online identity and we follow a transparency model since the beginning: the code is 100% open source and product development decisions are discussed openly with the community. SimpleLogin has received a lot of positive feedback from the privacy community and with your help, we have built many new features while maintaining high reliability and stability.
