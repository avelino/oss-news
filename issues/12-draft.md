## SimpleLogin joins the Proton family

The past 6 months have been intense for SimpleLogin, with many new users, many new features, and many new technical challenges. I’m now happy to share this news with you: SimpleLogin is now part of the [Proton family](https://protonmail.com/).

SimpleLogin was started in 2019. After more than a year of coding, we launched a beta version in 2020 and a public version at the beginning of 2021. SimpleLogin’s mission is to protect your online identity and we follow a transparency model since the beginning: the code is 100% open source and product development decisions are discussed openly with the community. SimpleLogin has received a lot of positive feedback from the privacy community and with your help, we have built many new features while maintaining high reliability and stability.

> “Docker run this container image. It works. We go to production. Docker run the same container image. It works.”

And maybe that’s all your team needs to do! And look, that’s okay. But I think understanding allows us to make that decision, and then we can decide what automation tool is the best for the job.

These fundamentals can be applied using different tools. The tools are not the fundamentals. It’s the ideas and concepts that we have been talking about today.
