## How we share SLIs across engineering departments

> At GitLab everyone can contribute to GitLab.com’s availability. We measure the availability using several Service Level Indicators (SLIs) But it’s not always easy to see how the features you’re building are performing. GitLab’s features are divided amongst development groups, and every group has their own dashboard displaying an availability score.

## 20VC: Gitlab CEO Sid Sijbrandij on Why You Are Not Allowed to Present in Meetings at Gitlab

> Listen to this episode from The Twenty Minute VC: Venture Capital | Startup Funding | The Pitch on Spotify. Sid Sijbrandij is the Co-founder & CEO @ GitLab. GitLab’s single application helps organizations deliver software faster and more efficiently while strengthening their security and compliance. Prior to their IPO last year, Sid raised funding from some of the best including ICONIQ, GV, Tiger, Coatue and D1 to name a few. Under his leadership, the company has grown to over 1,500 employees and over 30 million registered users. If that was not enough, Sid is also an active angel and sits on the board of Meltano, a spinout of Gitlab that allows you to manage all the data tools in your stack.

## [💬 Ask HN: Marketing, DevRel and Evangelism working for Open-source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30101292)

Why is it so difficult to find a space to communicate your open-source project to drive adoption at scale? To recruit new people inside a new company, it’s not easy to explain the open-source workflow to not-tech people, so most often, great open-source projects have lousy communication.

Evangelism, like GitLab said ([Developer Evangelist - UTMs for URL tagging and tracking](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/community-relations/developer-evangelism/)), is essential. That’s sure. But how to scale up a team to grow that skill inside the company?

Is it better to grow it internally (logically, a founder is the best person to communicate his project)? But how a tech person can develop marketing and communication skills?

Or the best way is to recruit a skilled DevRel person or instead of a marketing person and collaborate in creating great content?
