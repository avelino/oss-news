# 🌐 🗣️ Open Source Weekly - Issue #1

## Constant work to onboarding new members into engineering team

> Developing the _“onboarding”_ process for a new person in an engineering team takes a lot of dedication, and keeping this process fluid takes even more work (with as little friction as possible).
> This issue is challenging for any team working full time, it is even worse for Open Source projects where contributors usually work in their spare time. We should make this process as fluid as possible so that people don’t get discouraged by the complexity of getting up there and testing, until they make their first pull request.

## We are more than 75,000 people (stars 🌟) — awesome-go

> I’ve been meaning to write this blogpost since when we reached 10,000 stars 🌟 (I never imagined it would reach that number of people), but every day I reached more (and more) people and always thought the text would get outdated. Today is the day to thank everyone who uses, contributes and follows awesome-go, it’s time to celebrate 🎉🙌 — regardless of the number we reach and the people we help in some way.
