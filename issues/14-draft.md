## Spotify dances to the open source beat

Just about every technology company under the sun wants to align themselves with the open source, whether it’s Facebook open sourcing its own internal projects or Microsoft doling out north of $7 billion to acquire one of the biggest platforms [for open source developers](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/opensource/2018/06/07/github-acquisition-microsoft-commitment-open-source-developers/) — GitHub.

"The recent Log4j open-source software vulnerability is yet another example as to why safeguarding open-source software is critical," said [Slava Bronfman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/slava-bronfman/?originalSubdomain=il), CEO and co-founder of Cybellum, a cybersecurity platform maker located in Tel Aviv, Israel.
