The day has finally come: **NVIDIA IS PUBLISHING THEIR LINUX GPU KERNEL MODULES AS OPEN-SOURCE!** To much excitement and a sign of the times, the embargo has just expired on this super-exciting milestone that many of us have been hoping to see for many years.

_[...]_

There are many reasons why a company might choose to open source its internal technologies, or contribute to those maintained by other companies or individuals. For starters, it can help engage the broader software development community and serves as a useful recruitment tool.
