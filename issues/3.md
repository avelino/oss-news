## [General-purpose bitemporal database for SQL, Datalog & graph queries](https://github.com/xtdb/xtdb)

> [`XTDB` follows an unbundled architectural approach, which means that it is assembled from decoupled components through the use of an immutable log and document store at the core of its design. A range of storage options are available for embedded usage and cloud native scaling.](https://github.com/xtdb/xtdb)
> [Bitemporal indexing of schemaless documents enables broad possibilities for creating layered extensions on top, such as to add additional transaction, query, and schema capabilities. In addition to SQL, `XTDB` supplies a Datalog query interface that can be used to express complex joins and recursive graph traversals.](https://github.com/xtdb/xtdb)
