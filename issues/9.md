## Charming Pirates: Reframing user acquisition and referral for OSS

> Why should I care about being charming?
> The open source software community can learn a lot about how to attract new users and grow them into contributors and maintainers by thinking about their user journey, similar to how marketers and customer success teams think about new customers using ‚ÄúPirate Metrics.‚Äù
> A cri de coeur to start treating the ‚Äúfunnel to contributor‚Äù user journey on par with the ‚Äúfunnel to customer‚Äù user journey.
