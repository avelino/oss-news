Open source has played an enormous role in getting me closer to my next opportunity or goal. It has been a bridge between the life I have and the life I'm actively working towards.

Starting [Chakra UI](https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui) and getting to a place where it became very popular in the React community has been a journey into the unknown. I had little experience contributing to open source when I started Chakra UI, let alone experience managing such a popular project.

## GitHub Codespaces Add Support for Microservices and Monorepo Projects

GitHub continues to extend its cloud-based development environment Codespaces, aiming to make it more flexible and increase developer productivity. Specifically, the latest release of Codespaces targets teams [developing microservices or using a large monorepo](https://github.blog/2022-04-20-codespaces-multi-repository-monorepo-scenarios/).

After introducing [prebuilt Codespaces](https://dev.to/prestd/constant-work-to-onboarding-new-members-into-engineering-team-18k0) to speed the time required to spin up a development environment, GitHub has been working to make Codespaces better suited to working with multi-repository and monorepo projects and make it easier for larger organization to adopt them.

Earlier this year, the open-source community came under the scrutiny of a US Senate committee investigating a serious vulnerability in Log4j, a widely used, Java-based logging utility. Government experts say the vulnerability, called [Log4Shell](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa21-356a), was one of the most severe and widespread cybersecurity risks they've ever seen. The question is what to do now about security risks in open-source software—if anything.

"The recent Log4j open-source software vulnerability is yet another example as to why safeguarding open-source software is critical," said [Slava Bronfman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/slava-bronfman/?originalSubdomain=il), CEO and co-founder of Cybellum, a cybersecurity platform maker located in Tel Aviv, Israel.
