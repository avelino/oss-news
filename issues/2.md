## Breaking the Glass Ceiling in Tech: Aviyel Introduces #WomenInOpenSource

> The Open Source community is deemed fairly inclusive and democratized than the classic old-boys sectors. However, when it comes to plugging gender gaps, even open source has seen waves of exodus for women. Lack of diversity has haunted the OSS community ever since its inception. [Women in STEM](https://techjury.net/blog/women-in-technology-statistics/) statistics are stronger than ever this year; still, less than 3% of all open source contributors identified as women. The numbers are staggering at a time when the world is all the rage about web3 and talks of a decentralized internet.

## Conduit — Data integration for production data stores

> “Marketing teams and data engineers need data to answer questions; software engineers need data to build features. This difference is why you’ll find that tools like Segment don’t have connections for tools like ElasticSearch (Search Engine) or Redis (Cache). A business may use the modern data stack to ask better questions about what’s happening in their business, applications, etc. and this is a great use case. However, Conduit aims to solve a slightly different data problem for a separate data audience: software engineers.
