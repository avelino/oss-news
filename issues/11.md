## Kestra: a Scalable Open-Source Orchestration and Scheduling Platform

[Kestra](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra), a new open-source orchestration and scheduling platform, helps developers to build, run, schedule, and monitor complex pipelines.

It is built upon well-known tools like Apache Kafka and ElasticSearch.

ElasticSearch is used as a database that allows displaying, searching and aggregating all the data.
