## [Backstage project joins the CNCF Incubator](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2022/03/15/backstage-project-joins-the-cncf-incubator/)

The CNCF [Technical Oversight Committee](https://github.com/cncf/toc) (TOC) has voted to accept Backstage as a CNCF incubating project.

[Backstage](https://backstage.io/) is an open platform for building developer portals maintained by a global community. It unifies an organization‚Äôs tooling, services, apps, data, and docs into a single, consistent UI that allows developers to easily create, manage, and explore software.
Backstage was created at Spotify in 2016 when the company was growing incredibly quickly and onboarding new engineers was becoming a challenge. The project became Spotify‚Äôs mission-critical tool for containing software chaos and empowering engineers to work faster and more efficiently. Spotify open-sourced Backstage in March 2020 to share its experience with the broader community.
